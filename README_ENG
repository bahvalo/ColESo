Introduction
------------

Collection of exact solutions (ColESo library) consists of more than 
30 analytical solutions. The main purpose is the verification of 
numerical methods for compressible flow simulation. The base of 
the collection is a set of solutions of linearized Euler and 
Navier – Stokes equations. Besides, ColESo incorporates several 
nonlinear solutions, including the solution of Riemann problem.

Directories
-----------

There are seven directories in the main directory of this distribution,
described below

docs       This directory contains documents related to ColESo library.

example    This directory contains simple programs on FORTRAN, C, and C++
           illustrating the usage of ColESo library.

projects   This directory contains a solution for Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.

qd         This directory contains QD library (quad-double/double-double
           computation package). This package is not a part of ColESo library
           and is given for the benefit of the user.

src        This directory contains the source code of the ColESo library,
           including tests and the C++ header files.
           es_specfunc.cpp and es_specfunc_dd.cpp contains special functions.
           es_jacobi_rule.hpp contains Gauss - Jacobi quadrature formulas.
           es_aux.cpp implements outer interface.
           es_tests.cpp	contains some checks whether the solutions satisfy 
               the equations they should.
           io_parser.cpp is a file and formula parser with square wheels.
           Other *.cpp files implements one or more exact solutions.

templates  For each solution implemented in ColESo, this directory contains
           a file with the set of parameters. File format is described below.

test       This directory contains examples of the use of ColESo library
           that dumps data to plot figures. Examples are given in each 
           of the following languages: C++, C, and FORTRAN.
           To plot figures using the generated data, bash script and gnuplot
           are used.

Building of ColESo and running checks
-------------------------------------

Building is possible using Makefile. The description of targets is below.
All libraries and executables will be created in ./bin.

For Miscrosoft Visual Studio users, we enclose a solution containing two simple 
programs on C++, one of them uses double precision and another one uses 
double-double precision. To build the second one, the user should define the 
corresponding flag (#define EXTRAPRECISION_COLESO) in src/personal.h 
and rebuild the ColESo library.

Usage
-----

In order to compute an exact solution using ColESo library, one should 
proceed with the following operations.
1) Create an object corresponding to the solution in need.
2) Specify parameters of the solution or call the function reading them from file.
3) Call the function initializing the solution.
4) Call the function computing the solution at a point and a time moment given.
   This function can be called multiple times, at single- or multiple-thread mode.

Usage with C++
--------------

In C++, one can directly handle the objects corresponging to exact solutions.
Each exact solution corresponds to a class inheriting abstract class tPointFunction.

I. Create an object. 
To create an object corresponding to an exact solution one should create an instance
of the corresponding class. For example,
s_CornerPlanar S;

II. Specify parameters.
Parameters can be read from a file using method ReadParamsFromFile(const char*). 
For example, to read parameters from file.txt one can write
S.ReadParamsFromFile("file.txt");
If file name is not specified, then default file name corresponding to the class
will be used. In this case, this is es_cornerplanar.txt. 

Parameters can also be specified by direct assign to class members.
For example, to specify unit amplitude one can write
S.Aterm = 1.0;
Class members can slightly differ from the parameter names as they are read 
from the file. This correspondence becomes clear once one look at the 
code of the method ReadParams() of the corresponding class.

III. Initialize. 
Prior to compute the solution, the solution should be initialized. For example,
S.Init();

IV. Compute the solution. 
To compute the solution, one should use method PointValue. It takes time, coordinates, 
and a pointer to the output array. Minimal size of the output array depends on 
the solution type but not more than 10 elements.

Usage with C
------------

To be usable in programs written in C, ColESo library has the static
vector of objects accessible through a special interface.

I. Create an object. 
To create an object corresponding to an exact solution one should call the function
void coleso_add_function(char* FUNCNAME, int* ID);
This function takes the name of a solution, creates an object and returns 
its identifier (position in the vector). For example,
int ID; coleso_add_function("CornerPlanar", &ID);
Further access to the created object is provided via this identifier.

II. Specity parameters. 
Parameters can be read from a file using function
void coleso_read_file(int ID, char* FILENAME);
This function takes an identifier and a name of a file. For example,
coleso_read_file(ID, "PARAMS/es_cornerplanar.txt");

Parameters can also be specified using string-based interface, namely,
void coleso_set_parameter(char* PARAMNAME, char* PARAMVALUE);
void coleso_read_set(int ID);
The first function adds a parameter to the static string buffer, 
and the second one reads data from it similar to the reading from file.
Argument PARAMNAME coincides with the parameter name as it is written 
in file and does not obligatory coincide with the name of the class member.
For example,
coleso_set_parameter("Aterm", "1.0");
coleso_set_parameter("Bterm", "3.0");
coleso_read_set(ID);

III. Initialize. 
Prior to compute the solution, the solution should be initialized 
using function
void coleso_init(int ID);
For example,
coleso_init(ID);

IV. Compute the solution.
To compute the solution, one should use the function
void coleso_pointvalue(int ID, double T, double* C, double* V);
It takes time, coordinates, and a pointer to the output array. 
Minimal size of the output array depends on 
the solution type but not more than 10 elements.

Usage with FORTRAN
------------------

The use of ColESo in FORTRAN is similar to its use in C.
Note that each string passing to ColESo should be NULL-terminated 
for the correct treatment in C/C++.

An example of the use of ColESo in a program in FORTRAN 
can be found in example.f.

Parameters file format
----------------------

Parameters file is read line-by-line. Each line consists of a parameter name
and its value separated by spaces and/or tabs. 
Value is an arithmetic expression, where constant PI is defined. 
Starting from '#', all symbols in a line are ignored. 
Byte Order Mark (BOM) in the beginning of a file is unacceptable. 

In templates folder, some parameters are commented, i. e. disabled by placing 
'#' in the beginning of the line. This is for the benifit of the author. 
To use these parameters, symbol '#' should be removed.

Error treatment
---------------

In a case of error, ColESo does not return an error code to the calling subroutine.
It executes the macro crash(...) defined in personal.h. It can be redefined. 
In reading the parameters file and in some Init() subroutines, 
log is processing using the macro pprintf(...), which can also be redefined.
 
Thread-safety
-------------

ColESo library itself is thread-safe.

Interface for C and FORTRAN programs is based on static variables. 
When calling coleso_add_function, there must be no other access 
to ColESo at the same time. When specifying parameters of a solution, 
parameters of another solutions must not be specified.

Used libraries
--------------

ColESo uses several auxiliary functions from open source projects, including:

* library of Research Computing Center of Moscow State University,
  http://num-anal.srcc.msu.ru;
* Cephes, http://www.netlib.org/cephes
* GNU LibQuadMath, https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.4/libquadmath
* Jacobi quadrature rules by S. Elhay, J. Kautsky, J. Burkadrt,
  people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/cpp_src/jacobi_rule/jacobi_rule.html

Distribution conditions of these libraries may differ from the ones
of the rest of ColESo library.

In order to deal with extra precision floating point arithmetics,
ColESo uses the following library:

* QD – A C++/Fortran-90 double-double and quad-double package,
  https://github.com/aoki-t/QD
