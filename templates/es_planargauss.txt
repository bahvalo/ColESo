### Form of the solution
Aterm              1.0          # Amplitude of pressure pulsation 
Bterm              1.0          # Half-width of the Gaussian
NormalDistance  1e16            # Distance between Gaussian pulses; should be much greater than Bterm
#Rmax           1e50            # If set, solution is set to zero outsize the infinite circular cylinder with radius Rmax and axis direction DirX,DirY,DirZ
