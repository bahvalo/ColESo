### Steady source of finite width (1D)
### Space form of the source
#Form            GAUSSIAN            # Form of the source: GAUSSIAN or COS2
#Bterm           1.0                 # Width of the source (if Form==COS2) or Half-width of the Gaussian (if Form==GAUSSIAN)
#Aterm           1.0                 # If NormalizeForm is set, L1-norm of the source, amplitude otherwise
#NormalizeForm   1 

### Center of the main source (default: 0)
#CoorX           0.0

### Lattice of pulses (usually for the use with periodical boundary conditions)
#NumPeriodsX     0                   # additional sources with x=CoorX+iperx*PerX, where iperx=-NumPeriodsX, ..., NumPeriodsX
#PerX            1e10                # offset to the next source

### Time dependency of the source
#Ampl            1.0                 # multiplier. Note that there are two multipliers: Aterm and Ampl
#Freq            1.0                 # linear frequency
#Phase           0.0                 # phase shift
#tmin            0.0                 # source is disabled at t<tmin
#tmax            1e10                # source is disabled at t>tmax
#SignalType      1                   # form of the source in time: 1 - sine, 6 - fourth degree of sine
