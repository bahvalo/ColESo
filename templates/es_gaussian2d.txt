### Wave propagation from a 2D Gaussian pulse
### Pulse form
#Form              GAUSSIAN            # Form of the pulse. Only GAUSSIAN
#Aterm             1.0                 # Amplitude of the pulse
#Bterm             1.0                 # Half-width of the pulse
#NormalizeForm     0                   # If nonzero, Aterm is the L1-norm and not amplitude

### Pulse position
#CoorX             0.0
#CoorY             0.0

### Lattice of pulses (usually for the use with periodical boundary conditions)
#PerX           1e10                   # offset to the next pulse
#PerY           1e10                   # offset to the next pulse
#NumPeriodsX       0                   # additional pulses with x=CoorX+iperx*PerX, where iperx=-NumPeriodsX, ..., NumPeriodsX
#NumPeriodsY       0                   # additional pulses with y=CoorY+ipery*PerY, where ipery=-NumPeriodsY, ..., NumPeriodsY
#NAngularPeriods   1                   # if >1, additional pulses will be added by rotation by 2*Pi/NAngularPeriods
#Checkerboard      0                   # if nonzero, keep only even values of iperx+ipery

### Background flow. Sound speed is assumed to be equal to 1.0
#FlowVelX          0.0
#FlowVelY          0.0
