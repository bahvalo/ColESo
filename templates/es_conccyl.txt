### Couette flow between parallel plates and coaxial cylinders
### Problem geometry
CoorAxis           2                   # axis direction
X                  0.0                 # a point on the axis
Y                  0.0                 # a point on the axis
Z                  0.0                 # a point on the axis
RIn                1.0                 # radius of the inner cylinder
ROut               2.0                 # radius of the outer cylinder

### Cylinder velocities
OmegaIn            0.15                # angular velocity of the inner cylinder
OmegaOut           0.0                 # angular velocity of the outer cylinder

### Equation parameters
#Pr                1.0                 # Prandtl number
#gam               1.4                 # specific ratio
