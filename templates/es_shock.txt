### Shock wave (shock discontinuity) prescribed by fields at the supersonic side and Mach number of the shock
### Normal to the discontinuity and its position
ex 1.0          # normal to the discontinuity 
ey 0.0          # normal to the discontinuity 
ez 0.0          # normal to the discontinuity 
DF_Coor 200.0   # coordinate of the discontinuity in the normal direction, i. e. it has the form ex*x+ey*y+ez*z=DF_Coor

### Fields at the supersonic side
#Rho 1.0      # Density (default: 1.0)
#U   0.0      # Velocity (default: 0.0)
#P   1.0      # Pressure (default: 1.0)
#C   1.0      # Sound speed. Can be set instead of Rho or P

### Shock strength
#Mach 2.0     # Mach number of the shock
