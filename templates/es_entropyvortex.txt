### Entropy and vorticity perturbation with Gaussian profile
### Perturbation positions
Xterm        10.0
Yterm        10.0
#PerX        1e10     # Period (to use a lattice of perturbations). Should be much greater than Bterm
#PerY        1e10     # Period (to use a lattice of perturbations). Should be much greater than Bterm

### Perturbation parameters
Bterm         3       # Half-width of the Gaussian
Aterm1        0.1     # Multiplier for entropy perturbation
Aterm2        0.1     # Multiplier for vorticity perturbation

### Background flow (perturbations move in time with this velocity)
#FlowVelX     0.0
#FlowVelY     0.0
