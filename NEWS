Changes for 1.1  (21.06.2022)
    Most of the comments translated into English
    Math documentation added (now in Russian only)
    s_Couette admits \mu(T)=c*sqrt(T) and the Sutherland law
    s_ViscShock admits \mu=const, Pr=3/4 or Pr=infty with any rhoL/rhoR
    bug fixes


Known issues:
1. s_WaveInChannel, the case of a planar channel. Only even (symmetric w.r.t. channel center) are implemented.
